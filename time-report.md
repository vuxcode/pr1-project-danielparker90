Started around 3 weeks ago, fell behinnd due to unfortunate circumstances at home.
Firstly I worked on the name of my project which was a text based adventure game and a basic button which was "attack"
Step two was no change.
Step 3 I added extra buttons such as defend and run away.
Steps 4-5-6 there was not so much change I just added a script tag and a closing body tag.
Steps 7-8-9 were used to make sure I had the script tags in the correct spot so something started to show on screen.
Around 5-7hrs was spent figuring out to get the code to work.

Step 10 was added recently as I forgot to add the file
Around 1-2hrs here was used getting the right fonts, style and colours for the game. 
Step 11 I spent another hour trying ways to get the functions to work and something to happen in the code. 
Steps 12-13-14-15-16 were worked on at school using the "innertext" to show what happens when the output of the code is used.
Steps 17-18-19 were worked on at home for around 2-3hrs which was used to add the CPU and Player health and what actions
would be used by the user. Also maths functions were added to show what happens when the user makes a input. 
Steps 20-21-22-23. I spent more time trying to figure out the damage count and how to get the health bar to descrease to 0 and the game ending.
Steps 24-25-26-27-28-29-20 I had finally figured out the issues withe health bar and something was finally happening with game. I pulled a all nighter for this
and it took me from 8pm till 11am the followling day to have a almost working code
Step 31 and the final step were used to fix the issue i had when Run away was used as the game kept continuing after the run away button was activated. 
This was resolved by adding the gameover variable to the program which now stops the game when run away is input and you now have to click try again to play again.

To summarise I wish I did not have the issues at home and that I did not have to pull all nighters to fix my code. I am very happy with my project but I should
have planned better.
