Started around 3 weeks ago, fell behinnd due to unfortunate circumstances at home.
Firstly I worked on the name of my project which was a text based adventure game and a basic button which was "attack"
Step two was no change
Step 3 I added extra buttons such as defend and run away
Steps 4-5-6 there was not so much change I just added a script tag and a closing body tag.
