# Project Summary

This HTML/JavaScript code implements a simple browser-based text-based adventure game called "Dave the Dragon." The game revolves around the player engaging in combat with a dragon. 

The game tracks the health of both the player and the dragon, updates health bars visually, and ends when either the player or the dragon's health reaches zero. At the end of the game, a "Try Again" button appears, allowing the player to restart the game.

The game is very user friendly as it shows the health decreasing when in the user inputs "attack" or "defend"
The "Try Again" button allows players to quickly restart the game after it ends, without needing to refresh the browser.
The game prevents further actions once it’s over by disabling further interactions with buttons. Which was a big problem I had 
when it came to the "run away" input. 
The console.log shows the games logic is very easy to read. 

What would I like to improve in the future?
Introduce more combat options like heal or throw.
Introduce difficulty settings to make the game more difficlut or easier after time played. 
Adjust the randomness of damage to ensure fair gameplay as I felt the CPU did more damage than the user. 
Also add some stats about how much damage and wins the user has over the dragon.

# User Guide

The player can choose from three options:

Attack: Inflict damage on the dragon while taking damage in return.
Defend: Take reduced damage from the dragon’s attack.
Run Away: End the game and admit defeat.
